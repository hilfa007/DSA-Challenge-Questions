Tournament Winner

Problem statement:-
There is an algorithms tournament taking place where teams of programmers compete against each other to solve problems as fast as possible. Teams compete in a round-robin, where each team faces off against all other teams.
Only two teams compete against each other at a time, for each competition, one team is designated the home team while the other is the away team.
In each competition thereâ€™s always one winner and one loser, there are no ties.
A team gets 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses. The team with the most points wins.
For eg; if the results are given like [0 1 0]:- 1 indicates the home team won, and 0 indicates the away team won.
- Given an array of pairs representing the teams that have competed against each other and an array containing the result of each competition.
- Create a function that returns the winner of the tournament.

Constraint:- 
- The tournament will always have at least two teams.
- Each team will compete against all other teams exactly once.
- Exactly one team will win the tournament.

Input format:-
competitions : [["HTML", "C#"],
                          ["C#", "python"],
                          ["python", "HTML"]]
results : 0 0 1

Output format:-
"python"
