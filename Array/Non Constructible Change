Non Constructible Change

Problem statement:-
- Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you cannot create.
- The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren’t necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).
- For example, if you’re given coins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum amount of change that you can’t create is 4. If you’re given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can’t create is 1.

Constraint:- 
-  If the current coin is greater than change + 1, the smallest impossible change is equal to change + 1.

Input format:-
coins :  [1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 10]

Output format:-
26

Test Cases:-
1) Input :
     coins :  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    Output :
     22

2)Input :
     coins :  [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]
   Output :
     1
