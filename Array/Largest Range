Largest Range

Problem statement:-
- Range is the set of consecutive numbers.
- Given an array of integers , We have to find the largest set of consecutive numbers(range) present in the array.
  (A range doesn't necessarily have to have all the consecutive numbers next to each other in the array.  ).
- Return an array with the first and last integers in this range.

- For eg:-   If we have an array,
  arr =  [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
  In arr, the largest set of consecutive numbers present : {1,2,3,4}.
  Here, The task is to return an array containing first and last elememts of the above range ,that is : [1,4]

Input format:-
[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Output format:-
[1,4]

Test Cases:-
1) Input :
      [1, 11, 3, 0, 15, 5, 2, 4, 10, 7, 12, 6]
   Output :
      [0, 7]

2) Input :
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 9, 10, 11, 6]
   Output :
      [0,6]
