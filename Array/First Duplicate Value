First Duplicate Value

Problem statement:-
- Given an array of integers arr[ ].
- If there are more than 1 duplicated number, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does.
- If there are no such elements, return -1.

Constraint:- 
- The value of the elements in the array should be less than or equal to the size of the array.
  I.e : - 1<=value<= size(array).
- The output should exactly be the first occurring duplicate value.

Input format:-
array :  [5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]

Output format:-
3

Test Cases:-
1) Input :
      array : [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2]
    Output :
      3
2)Input :
     array : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   Output :
