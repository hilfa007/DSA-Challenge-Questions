Minimum Rewards

Problem statement:-
- Imagine you are a teacher and you have just graded the final exam that students had to take.
- Given an array consisting of N positive integers representing the scores of N students.You are going to reward the students based on the scores they have got.
- The task is to find the minimum number of rewards you have to give out to N students such that every student gets at least one reward and the students having the higher scores get more rewards than its neighbours.
- Return the minimum number of rewards.

Constraint:- 
- The order of the input array matters.Each position represents a student.
- Every students has to have atleast one reward.
- The students with the higher scores get more rewards than its neighbours.
- when iterating back, the reward at an index (for eg:- reward[j] )could either be the maximum of the reward at that specific index (reward[j]) or the maximum of the reward of the following index + 1 (reward[j+1] + 1). Then compare both values with the neighbouring rewards.

Input format:-
scores : [8, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 5]

Output format:-
25

Test Cases:-
1) Input :
      scores : [8, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 5]
    Output :
      25

2) Input :
      scores : [1, 0, 2]
   Output :
      5
