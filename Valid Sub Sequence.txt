Valid Sub Sequence

Problem statement:-
- Given two non-empty arrays of integers(array, sequence), write a function(validSubSequence) that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
- For example, given an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], a valid subsequence would be [2,4,6,8,10]. The numbers aren’t directly next to each other, but they are in the same order as when these integers were in the original array.
- If the sequence is a valid sub-sequence, then return 1 or else return 0.

Constraint:- 
- A subsequence of an array doesn’t have to be adjacent in the given array but is in the same order as they appear in the array.

Input format:-
array : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
sequence : 1 2 3 5

Output format:-
1

Test Cases:-
1) Input :
     array : 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 22
     sequence : 2 3 5 1
    Output :
     0

2)Input :
    array : 11 22 43 65 34 21 12 32 23 44
    sequence : 22 65 34 12
   Output :
    1
