Shifted Binary Search

Problem statement:-
- You are given a shifted array. The task is to find a given value from this array.
- The problem asks you to find a number from a sorted array but all the numbers has been shifted by some amount either left or right.
- For Example:{9, 19, 21, 2, 8} the array is sorted from index 0 to 2 and then we have the value 2 which is less than 21 and then again from index 3 to 4 the array is sorted again. 
- Notice that for the array to be sorted, all the values from index 0 to 2 are supposed to come after the value 8 which is at index 4. So, the problem give you this kind of shifted array and asks you to find the position of a given value from this array.

Input format:-
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
target = 0

Output format:-
4

Test Cases:-
1) Input :
      nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
      target = 3
    Output :
       -1

2) Input :
     nums = [1]
     target = 0
    Output :
      -1

3) Input :
      nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
      target = 0
    Output :
      4
